# Custom Signal Distribution Board

An experiment in cleaning up the wiring mess of a quadcoptor and the standardization of all connections to increase component interchangeability.

##About

Having never CAD'd a PCB (only etched) this is all new territory. 

* The project uses [Osmond Cocoa](http://www.osmondpcb.com/) / PCB to build gerber files and Postscript files (proofs). 
* Was provided great help and assistance by (Dan at) [OSH Park](https://oshpark.com/) walking me through some design issues and best practice as well as direction in handling [DRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_rule_checking).

# Version 1.0

Initial test run of board, alpha version.

* __todo__ Board proofed at 37mm x 37mm.
 * make 36mm x 36mm.
* __todo__ Board outline ```*.GKO``` is actually screen 2 layer, there is no screen 2 on this batch.
 * Make something sexy for bottom silk.
